Purpose of Each Command

df -h:
Displays disk usage for each filesystem in a human-readable format, making it easier to assess available space.
Useful for system administrators to monitor disk space.


du -ah | sort -rh | head -n 15:
du -ah lists all files and their sizes.
sort -rh orders the files by size in descending order.
head -n 15 limits the output to the top 15 largest files.
This combination is essential for identifying large files that may be consuming significant storage.


find <directory> -type f -mtime -1 | head -n 15:
Searches for files (-type f) modified within the last 24 hours (-mtime -1) in the specified directory.
This is helpful for tracking recently changed files, which can be useful for troubleshooting or managing backups.

find <directories> -type f -size +<threshold> -exec rm -v {} ;:
Locates files in /tmp and /var/tmp exceeding a given size threshold (-size +<threshold>).
Deletes the identified files using rm -v, with verbose output to show whatâ€™s being removed.
This prevents temporary files from overloading disk space, especially in systems with heavy usage of temporary storage.

Learning Outcomes

learned how powerful commands like df, du, and find can be for file and disk management. They allow precise control over file searches, sorting, and cleanup.

learned how to create a tool that is both reusable and interactive.

learned how to handle errors like invalid directories and ensuring the script gracefully deals with incorrect inputs
